    <h1>Webb telescope launch date slips again</h1>
    <p>While it is not pleasant to hear about further delays to launching the James Webb Space Telescope, it is nonetheless clear that NASA is finally bringing this project closer to space. Webb's launch has been delayed for more than a decade by technical problems and by the need for extensive testing. Some of this is understandable, however. Launching and deploying Webb successfully would be a masterful featâ€”unfurling it in deep space requires 50 major deployments and 178 major release mechanisms. All of these must work, or the instrument will fail.</p>
